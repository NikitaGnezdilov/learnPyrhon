Daily Work Report
Date: June 28, 2024

Today I studied:

1) Python Basics:
    "for" loops: learned the basics of writing loops, particularly the "for num in range" construct.
    "if", "elif", "else" statements: reviewed the main constructs for code branching.
2) Working with Lists:
    Using the "sum()" function to sum the elements of a list.
    Accessing dictionary values using "name.values()".
3) Problem Solving:
    Solved about 35 simple problems, applying the studied constructs and methods.
4) Mathematical Operations:
    Studied all basic mathematical operators: %, !=, +=, -=, //, /, *, **, +, - and etc.
5) Additional Topics:
    Touched on using the "math.sqrt" function to calculate square roots.
    Learned the method of exponentiation using the "pow()" function for numbers and lists.

The code for completed tasks was not saved due to technical problems
The problems were taken from the code.mu website
