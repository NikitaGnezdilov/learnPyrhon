Daily Work Report
Date: June 28, 2024

Today I studied:

1) Python Basics:
    "for" loops: learned the basics of writing loops, particularly the "for num in range" construct.
    "if", "elif", "else" statements: reviewed the main constructs for code branching.
2) Working with Lists:
    Using the "sum()" function to sum the elements of a list.
    Accessing dictionary values using "name.values()".
3) Problem Solving:
    Solved about 35 simple problems, applying the studied constructs and methods.
4) Mathematical Operations:
    Studied all basic mathematical operators: %, !=, +=, -=, //, /, *, **, +, - and etc.
5) Additional Topics:
    Touched on using the "math.sqrt" function to calculate square roots.
    Learned the method of exponentiation using the "pow()" function for numbers and lists.

The code for completed tasks was not saved due to technical problems
The problems were taken from the code.mu website

Report on Completed Work
Today I reinforced my knowledge of functions by writing my own code, which serves as a prototype for authorization and registration in any system. The code is simple and not entirely correct, but for just four days of learning Python, I believe I did a good job.

Achievements:
Reinforcing the topic of functions: I created functions for user registration and authorization, which helped me better understand their syntax and usage.
Practical application of knowledge: Writing code that implements a simple authorization and registration system helped me see how theoretical knowledge is applied in practice.
Developing programming skills: Despite some inaccuracies in the code, this project was an important step in developing my programming skills in Python.
Future Plans:
Improving knowledge and skills: I will continue solving problems from various websites to enhance my practical skills and knowledge.
Enhancing the written code: I plan to refine and improve the written code based on the knowledge and advice I receive.
Learning new topics: I will study new topics and concepts in Python to broaden my knowledge and capabilities.
Conclusion
Four days of learning Python have given me a good start and confidence in my abilities. I will continue working and improving to achieve even greater success in programming.
